Human Activity Recognition is the process of recognizing, classifying, and monitoring human actions based on videos and wearable sensors with the help of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The field of computer vision mainly uses video-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) models. In this report, Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network(LRCN), pre-trained Inception v3 model with Simple Recurrent neural network(RNN), Gated recurrent units(GRU), and Long short-term memory(LSTM) are applied to videos belonging to 4 action
categories of UCF50 dataset. When these models are applied to a test set, and unknown YouTube videos, the train and validation accuracy, loss, and prediction probabilities of activity recognition have been calculated.
